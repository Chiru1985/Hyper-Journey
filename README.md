# Hyper-Journey: A WebXR Experience

## Description
Hyper-Journey is an immersive WebXR experience designed to visualize and celebrate the learning journey, particularly focusing on module achievements. Users navigate through a virtual world, encountering milestones and interactive modules that symbolize knowledge acquisition and personal growth.

## Features
*   **Immersive WebXR Environment:** Explore a 3D world built with A-Frame.
*   **Module Achievements:** Visual effects for module completion, where module icons glow, flash, and animate into the character model's backpack, symbolizing learning and integration.
*   **Proximity-Based Interactions:** Interactive panels that become visible when the user's character enters a defined trigger zone around a module icon.
*   **Dynamic Progress Tracking:** (Implied by "The Journey of Change" theme and character movement)
*   **Background Music Control:** Toggle background music on/off.

## Technologies Used
*   **A-Frame:** A web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences.
*   **WebXR Device API:** For enabling immersive experiences directly in the browser.
*   **JavaScript:** For core logic, animations, and interactive components.
*   **HTML:** Structure of the WebXR scene and UI elements.
*   **CSS:** Styling for loading screens, controls, and other UI.

## How to Run/Install
To run the Hyper-Journey WebXR experience locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Hyper-Journey
    ```
2.  **Serve the files:** You need a local web server to run WebXR content due to browser security restrictions.
    *   **Using Python (if installed):**
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
    *   **Using Node.js (if installed, install `serve` globally):**
        ```bash
        npm install -g serve
        serve . -p 8000
        ```
    *   **Using VS Code Live Server extension:** If you're using VS Code, you can install the "Live Server" extension and open `index.html` with it.
